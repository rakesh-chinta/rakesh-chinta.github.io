        <p><strong> What I do</strong></p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p class="title">
          <li> There was always something I wanted to provide, create, innovate, disrupt throughout my life. This led me building and designing and learning almost everything I can get my hands on, I was very resourceful and scrappy: allowing myself to be productive, creative with the little resources which we have access to as students. </li>
          <li>This led me to software development, app development, building my own businesses in the realms of Software consulting, Businesses consulting, product design consulting and Creative Consulting, but always found something was missing: it was either too technical, focusing too much on business or ignoring the customer, who is the ultimate judge of the product.</li>
          <li>This led me to form a passion for the intersection of these three focuses: at Product Management, having worked at several companies and made an impact with some amazing projects, I can confidently say that I have toned and enhanced my skills and way of thinking. </li>
          <li>I read every day on new frameworks of business which can be integrated into the process, along with keeping up with technology and getting my hands dirty by directly analyzing data and programming: this allows me to have a strong technical judgment. What I have also done is Product Design: making a versatile product portfolio about my ideas on Dribbble, Behance and on my website: I designed the UI/UX and started making my ideas into a reality, which I think is the most important part of being a product manager. </li> 
          <li>I believe that gives me the drive I need to truly contribute to the mission of building products and services which in turn provide value for both the organization as well as millions.</li>
